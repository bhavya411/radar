Resilience 4J,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p>Resilience4j is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by Netflix Hystrix, but designed for Java 8 and functional programming</p>"
Spring Cloud Gateway,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p>This project provides a library for building an API Gateway on top of Spring WebFlux. Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency.<p>"
Reactive Streams,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,<p>Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure. This encompasses efforts aimed at runtime environments (JVM and JavaScript) as well as network protocols.<p>
Functional Programming (Lambda),Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p> Lambda is the first concept introduced in Java and is the basis of the other concepts that functional programming brings in Java.  Lambda expressions allow passing a function as an input parameter for another function, which was not possible earlier. In short, lambdas can replace anonymous classes, making the code readable and easy to understand.<p>"
Apache Beam,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p>Apache Beam is a unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines, as well as a set of language-specific SDKs for constructing pipelines and Runners for executing them on distributed processing backends, including Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Google Cloud Dataflow, and Hazelcast Jet.<p>"
Scikit Learn,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p>Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.</p>"
Computer Vision,Trial,Tool,FALSE,"<p>Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.</p>"
Tensorflow,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,<p>TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.</p>
MLOps,Trial,Technique,FALSE,"<p>MLOps or ML Ops is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. The word is a compound of “machine learning” and the continuous development practice of DevOps in the software field. Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems. When an algorithm is ready to be launched, MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers to transition the algorithm to production systems.</p>"
Oracle Cloud,Trial,Platform,FALSE,"<p>Oracle Cloud is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage, network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data centers. The company allows these services to be provisioned on demand over the Internet.</p>"
Observability,Trial,Technique,FALSE,"<p>Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. In control theory, the observability and controllability of a linear system are mathematical duals. The concept of observability was introduced by Hungarian-American engineer Rudolf E. Kálmán for linear dynamic systems. A dynamical system designed to estimate the state of a system from measurements of the outputs is called a state observer or simply an observer for that system.</p>"
Katalon Studio,Trial,Tool,TRUE,"<p>Katalon Studio is an automation testing software tool developed by Katalon, Inc. The software is built on top of the open-source automation frameworks Selenium, Appium with a specialized IDE interface for web, API, mobile and desktop application testing.</p>"
BDD,Trial,Technique,FALSE,<p>Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>
Cypress,Trial,Tool,TRUE,"<p>Cypress is a free and open source automation tool, MIT-licensed and written in JavaScript. As of this writing, it has over 19.3K Stars on Github and is used by organisations such as NASA and DHL. With help of Cypress End to End test , integration and unit tests are easy to write and debug.</p>"
React JS,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>"
NodeJS,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,"<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a ""JavaScript everywhere"" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.</p>"
Responsive Web Designs,Trial,Technique,FALSE,"<p>Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD.Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.</p>"
Akka GRPC,Trial,Language/Framework,FALSE,<p>Akka gRPC provides support for building streaming gRPC servers and clients on top of Akka Streams and Akka HTTP.</p>
Scala3,Trial,Language/Framework,TRUE,"<p>Scala 3 is a complete overhaul of the Scala language. At its core, many aspects of the type-system have been changed to be more principled. While this also brings exciting new features along (like union types), first and foremost, it means that the type-system gets (even) less in your way and for instance type-inference and overload resolution are much improved. </p>"
Sentry,Trial,Tool,FALSE,"<p>Sentry is a service that helps you monitor and fix crashes in realtime. The server is in Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any language, in any application. Focus on Scala API.</p>"
